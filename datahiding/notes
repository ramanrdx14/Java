Data-Hiding :
------------
1. Data hiding is the process of hiding the data from the outside 
   users.

2. It is achieved by private access modifier

Example :
---------
class Account{
	private int bal; // data hiding
	//code
}

To access or modify or update the private variables java provide
some special methods ex: getter and setter methods.

It is highly recomended to declare the data members as private.

=====================================================================

Abstraction :
-------------
Hiding the inner implemenations and showing the set of services
we are offering.

Ex: Car Internal working of brake,gear are hidden
    ATM Machine is implemented in which language,DB connection hidden 
    It is achieved by abstract class and interface
    
=====================================================================

Abstract Class:
--------------
These contain both concrete and abstract method.

abstract class Test{

abstract void sum();

void mux(){

}


}
=====================================================================
Points to Remember :
--------------------

1. If the class contains abstract methods then the class should be
   declared as abstract class

2. If we declare any abstract class, then it can contain both 
   concrete methods and abstract methods.
   
3. We can not instantiate of an abstract class but we can declare
   the reference for the abstract class.
   
4. If any class inherits abstract class then it should implement 
   all the abstract methods or that class should be declared as
   abstract.
   
5. When ever we are using abstraction then the method overriding
   concept will be used.
   
6. Abstract class can have constructors.

7. Abstract class can inherit the concrete class.

=====================================================================
    
Abstract Methods :
-------------------
Abstract Methods are those whose implementation part is hided.

Abstract methods are those who does'not have body(implementation)

Abstract methods are those who have only declaration part not
implementation.

To declare abstract methods we have to use abstract keywords

Ex:
--
abstract void sum();

Interview Questions :
---------------------
1. Concrete Methods vs Abstract method?

=> Abstract has only declaration
   Concrete has declaration and implementation
   
=> Abstract method uses abstract keyword
   We don't  have to use abstract keyword
   
   
2. Concrete class and Abstract class ?

=> Concrete class can contain concrete methods
   Abstract class can contain  both abstract and concrete methods
   
   We can not create Object for abstract class
   We can create object for abstract class
   
   Abstract class can be declared by abstract keyword.
   Concrete class does not contain abstract keyword
