Static Keyword :
---------------
Static keyword is the non-access modifiers 

1. We can use the static keyword with 
   1. variables
   2. block
   3. method
   4. Inner class (not outer class)
   
   
2. Use of Static keyword :
   1. It is used to improve the share-ability
   2. It is used for the memory management
   3. Static member belongs to the class not Objects.

Static Variables:
----------------
-> If we declare any variable as static then it is known as static variable.

-> Static variables gets the memory allocated in the method area at the time of
   class loading.
   
Points to Remember :
--------------------
1. We cannot create static local variable because the main use of static variable
   is to improve share-ability but the local variable have limited 
   
2. If we declare any variable in the static method then it will be treated as the 
   local variable only.
   
3. We cannot use the instance variable inside the static method but we can use 
   static variable inside the instance method.

Static Block :
--------------

-> A block created using static keyword is called as static block.
-> static block is executed at the time of class loading
-> Use of static block
   1. We can create static block to initialize static variables 
   2. we can create static block to load native libraries at class loading
