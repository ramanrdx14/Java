Dependency Injection :
----------------------
-> Dependency Injection is the concept in which Object gets other required
   Object from the outside entity.

-> The Process of injecting of dependent object into the contained object
   is called dependency injection.
   
-> While programming the java classes should be minimum dependent as 
   less as possible.by this we will increase the possibility of the 
   reusing the classes and able to test them independently.
   
Outer object : Container Object
Inner object : Contained object



Types of Dependency Injection :
-------------------------------
1. Constructor Dependency Injection   based 
2. Setter Method Dependency Injection based


Circular DI:
------------
it is the process of depending two objects in the circular form 
one object is dependent on second object and second object is dependent
on first object.

Note: We can't achieve Circular DI with constructor


Uses-A Relationship :
---------------------
It is the relationship in which the a method of one class uses a 
Object of another class.
