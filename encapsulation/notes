Encapsulation :
---------------
What is encapsulation ?
=> Wrapping of variables and methods are wrapped into the single 
   unit is called encapsulation.
   
=> Encapsulation is technically hiding the data from other classes
   and these data can be accessed only through the member functions
   of its own classes 

=> Real World Example : capsule,mobile

=> Technically every java class is the example of encapsulation

=> Main Example of encapsulation is java bean classes.

=> Encapsulation is achieved by declaring variable as private
   and getter and setter methods.
   
=> For Example :
   class Employee{
   	private int salary;
   	
   	public void setSalary(int salary){
   	this.salary = salary;
   	}
   	
   	public int salary(){
   	return salary;
   	}
   
   }
   
Advantages of Encapsulation :
-----------------------------
1. Data Hiding
2. Increase flexibility
3. Testing Code is easy


Java Bean Class :
-----------------
-> Must Implement Serializable interface
-> class must contain public no-arg constructor
-> class must have all private variables
-> class must contain public getter and setter methods

Tightly Encapsulated class :
-----------------------------
It contains all the variables as private


Interview Questions:
--------------------
Abstraction : abstraction hides the implementation
Encapsulation: It hide the data (information)

Encapsulation = Data Hiding + Abstraction

Abstraction can be achieved by Abstract class and Interface
Encapsulation can be achieved by java bean class


6 Main Pillers of OOPS :
------------------------
1. Class 
2. Object & Methods
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Abstraction
6. Encapsulation
