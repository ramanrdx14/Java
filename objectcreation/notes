How Objects are Created ?
-------------------------

When we compile the program javac Animal.java
Compiler will check the syntex and if the syntex is correct then it will create .class
files. No of .class files will be generated depending on the number of classes present
in the file.

When we run the program.
2.1 Animall file will loaded in JVM mem area which is method Area

2.2 An object of java.lang.class will be created insite the heap area in which 
    Animal main class metadata will be stored

2.3 Now Main Method will be executed and for this JVM will create a new thread known
    as main thread.

2.4 As soon as main thread is created then the JVM will create a main stack in Stack 
    Area
    
2.5 Now thread will execute line Animall a = new Animall() and it will load the Animall
    class inside the Method Area and a new Object is created in the Heap Area.
    
    
2.6 Now there is new keyword so new object creation process will start. 
	JVM will instruct heap manager to create an object of Animal class but heap
 	manager will ask for object size to JVM. Then JVM will calculate the size of
  	object according to the number of instance variables that are declared in Animal 
  	class and this size will be taken by heap manager and heap manager will create
  	an object in heap area

2.7 As soon as heap manager creates an object, a unique integer value will be assigned
	 to the object which is known as "hashcode"

2.8 This hascode value will be provided to the JVM and JVM will convert this hascode 
	vallue into hexadecimal form and this hexadecimal value is known as reference value

2.9. Now this hexadecimal value will be assigned to the variable which is known as 
	 reference variable

2.10 Now object will be initialized that means all instance variables will be assigned 
	by default values or by their original values.
