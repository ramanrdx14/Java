packages:
---------
-> A package is group of similar classes and interfaces or sub-packages
-> A package is a folder which contains the classes or interfaces (.class)

Advantages:
-----------
1. maintainblity
2. readeablity
3. abstraction
4. security
5. packages can be used to resolve naming conflicts
6. packages are used to achive reuseablity


Types of packages:
-----------------
1. Predefined packages
2. User defined packages
	
	
How can we import the packages:
-------------------------------
to import the packages there are 3 ways :

1. import java.package.subpackage.*;
2. import packagename.subpackgename.classname/interfacename
3. fully qualified name

java.lang package is only package which is by default imported to every java
class 


User Defined package :
-----------------------
The package which is created by the user acording to the project requirement 
is called user defined package.


to create a package 

package pkg_name;
class Test{


}


To compile it we will use javac -d . PackageDemo.java(d represent the directory
and . represent the current directory.)

go inside the package and run the program


Points to remember :
--------------------
1. Package Decleration must be the first statement in the program
2. there can be only one package statement


How to import packages :
------------------------
-> There are 3ways to import the packages in java

1. import packagename.classname
2. import packagename.*;
3. by using fully qualified name


Points to remember :
--------------------
1. It should be 2nd line of the program
2. import statment doesnot load the class to the memory it only provide the 
   accessablity to use the class.
   
   
   
What are Jar Files :
--------------------
-> Full Form is Java Archive Files
-> It is compressed form of all the resources(.class,packages,images,etc..)

How to create JAR Files:
------------------------
jar -cf  Jarfilename.jar files_names
jar -cf  Jarfilename.jar *


Viewing Jar Files Content :
---------------------------
jar tf jarfilename.jar (tf table format)
 

How to execute JAR Files:
-------------------------
jar -xf jarfilename.jar (xf extract file) 


MANIFEST.MF
-----------
-> this file is present in every jar file which represent the features of jar
   files

-> whenever we create jar file it automatically create under meta-inf

-> the default menifest file contains 2 enteries in the form of name value
   pairs but we can insert the more in MENIFEST.MF file
   
   
-> How to insert the data in Manifest.MF file
	1. create any text file with any name and provide the values in it using
	   name value pairs
	   
	2. then provide the command in CMD
	   jar -cmf JarFileName.jar textfilename.text
	   
   
   Note:
   -----
   we have to provide the space after name and colon
   

Executable Jar File:
--------------------
The jar file which contains main method is called executable jar file

To create the executable jar file we have to provide the Main-Class name 
value pair in executable jar file
