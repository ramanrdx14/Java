Constructor
------------

-> Constructors are the special class methods same as class name which do not have
   return type.
   
   Example:
   --------
   class Test{
   
   	Test(){
   	}
   	
   }
   
--> Use of constructor is used to initialize the objects.
--> Constructor are executed automatically at the time of object creation.


Types of constructor:
---------------------
1. Default
2. 0-Arguement Constructor
3. Parameterized

4. To checked the Default Constructor we can use "javap classname.java"



Default Constructor:
--------------------
-> When ever we don't create any constructor in the class, then the compiler will
   always create a constructor which is known as default constructor.
  
-> Default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 
   0,null etc depending on the type.
   
-> If the programmer use any constructor then JVM will not create any constructor

-> We can use any access modifiers for the constructor.

-> Access Modifiers for the default constructor cannot be private or protected because
   the outer class cannot be private or protected.

-> Default constructor has only one line of code 

 class Test{
   
   	Test(){
   	  super();
   	}
   	
  }

   
   
   
Note:
----
We cannot use abstract,final,static,synchronized keywords in the constructor




0 - Args Constructors:
-----------------------
This constructors are created by the programmer.

class Test{
	
	Test(){
	
	}
	
}


Parameterized Constructor :
----------------------------
This constructors are created by the programmer.

class Test{
	
	Test(int a,int b){
	
	}
	
	
Difference Between Constructor & methods:
-------------------------------------------
1. Methods always have return type
   Constructors doesn't have return type
   
2. Methods can have valid name
   Constructor can have name as same Class name
   
3. Methods are used to perform the particular task 
   Constructor are used to initialize the Objects
   
   
Topics:
-------
1. constructors can be inherited
2. constructors can be overloading and overriding
3. constructor  chaining using this keyword
4. use of super keywords
5. constructors with abstract class and interface


Note:
----
Constructor is predefined class present inside the java.lang.reflect package

Constructor class is used to get the constructor related information
