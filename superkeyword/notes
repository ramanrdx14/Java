Super Keyword :
--------------
The Super keyword is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent
class object.

1. It is used to refer the immediate parent class instance variable
2. Super keyword is used to invoke the parent class method
3. Super keyword is used to invoke the parent class constructor
	-> If we don't provide super() in the constructor then the compiler provide it
	   explicitly.
	   
	-> super() should be the first statement in the constructor.
	
	Points to remember :
	--------------------

	3. What is the difference between super and super()
