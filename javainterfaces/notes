Interfaces :
------------
These are similar to abstract class which can contain variables
and methods but having all the variables and method as public 
static final and methods as public abstract.


All the methods in the interface are abstract they don't have 
implementations.

Interface is the blue print of class which specifies what must do
but not how ..

Syntex:
-------

access_modifier interface interface_name extends i2,i3,i4..{

--X--- varibales(public static final)
--X---(public abstract)

}


interface Vehicle{
  
  void start();
  void changeGear();
}


-> Use Of Interface :
---------------------
1. It is used to achieve total abstraction.

2. It is used to achieve multiple inheritance(as multiple inheritance is not in java in classes)

3. It is used achieve loose coupling

Interview Questions :
---------------------
What is the difference between concrete class,abstract class
and interface  

=> Concrete class can only contain concrete methods
   Abstract class can contain both abstract and concrete methods
   Interfaces can contain abstract methods
   
   
=> We use class keyword for concrete class
   We use abstract keyword for abstract class
   we use interface keyword for interfaces
   
=> We can create objects for concrete class
   We can not create object for Interface and Abstract class.we can provide Reference variable name
   

=> We cannot achieve abstraction from concrete class
   We can achieve partial abstraction from abstract class
   We can achieve full abstraction in interface
   
   
=> Constructors are allowed in concrete class
   Constructors are allowed in abstract class
   Constructors are not allowed in interface class
   
   
   POINTS :
   ------
   1. Interface cannot be private or protected but nested can 
      be any thing
      
   2. Interface represent is a relationship
   
   3. Interface new features
      1. default implemented methods allowed 1.8v
      2. we can create static methods in interface 1.8v
      3. private methods in interface 1.9v
      4. private static methods in interface 1.9v
      
Marker Interface ?
------------------
Any Interface which does not contains any methods or variable
is called marker interface.

It is used to provide some extra features to object at runtime

Ex:
--
1. clonable interface
2. RMI
3. serializable interface
Syntex:
------
interface i1{

}
